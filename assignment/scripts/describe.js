// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called name and set it to Dane as the value
// If the name is equal to Mary, the console will say, "Hi, Mary!"
//Otherwise, if the name value isn't Mary, the console will say, "How do you do?"
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// A variable called secret is created, but without a value
// A variable called code is created with a value of 123
// If the code is equal to 123, the secret is 'super' and the code is a value of code * 2
// Otherwise, if the code is greater than 250, the secret is 'duper'
// We console.log 'secret'

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// A variable of isstudent is set in boolean as true
// A variable of age is set at 34
// A variable of zip is set at 55407
// If isStudent is true and the zip is greater than 80000, then console will respond 'You're a student on the West Coast'
// Otherwise, if isStudent is false and the age is less than 30, then console will respond 'What are your hobbies?'
// Otherwise, if isStudent is true, console will respond 'Welcome to Prime!'
// We console.log 'How about the weather?'


//CODE
/*

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

// colorOne should have been set to blue
// colorTwo should have been set to red
// There needs to be some code to indicate that colorTwo is purple if mix is true.  This was left out
// A console.log would need to be added to generate a response

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

// Need to add let before the constant time variable
// There should be a && rather than || to indicate that 'higher than 39 and greater than or equal to 4' are true

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

// Should be let minAge = 21 rather than const minAge = 21;
// Code should be written to indicate that age needs to be >= minAge to allow entry. This is written backwards in the code and will generate an incorrect response


/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
} else {
  console.log('enter');
}
